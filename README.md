## Project Description:

How does a UCSD pitcher compare to major league standards by pitch quality?  

The UC Sand Diego Baseball team wants to better understand how their pitcher’s execution of pitches compares to that Major League pitchers so they may have more clear coaching objectives. To execute this coaching strategy (sometimes known as pitch design), the pitching coach wants to know if Major League pitches can be classified by ball path and spin characteristics. If so, can we then rate the quality of our pitcher’s pitches compared to major League standards?

## Key Learning Objectives

1.  Create classification model using PitchFx data to identify primary pitch features and classify pitches by these features.   
2.  Compare model classifications to manually identified pitches from UCSD pitchers.
3.  Visualize difference between individual pitchers and Major League pitch standards.

## Secondary Objectives

1. Use model to reclassify UCSD pitch types based on features.
2. Create ‘grade’ for UCSD pitch quality compared to Major League standards.
